# Footwear Classification using MLP

In this project, I have performed image classification of footwear using a multilayer perception model. The DataSet used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, Shoe vs Sandal vs Boot Image Dataset. It contains around 15,000 images with a resolution of 136x102 pixels in an RGB color model.  
Initially, I converted the images into binary and resized them to 64x64 pixels. Then I implemented a model with 3 hidden layers and got over % accuracy. Finally, I tried a Randomized Search to find the best hyperparameters.
