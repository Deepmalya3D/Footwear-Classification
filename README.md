# Footwear Classification using MLP

In this project I have performed image classification of footwears using multilayer perceptrons. The DataSet used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, Shoe vs Sandal vs Boot Image Dataset. It contains around 15,000 images, each with a resolution of 136x102 pixels in RGB color model.  
Initially I have converted the images into binary, and resized them in 64x64 pixels. Then I have implemented a model with 3 hidden layers, and got over % accuracy. Finally I tried Randomized Search to find te best hyperparameters.
